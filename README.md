# wireframing
Wireframing is the process of creating a visual blueprint that outlines the basic structure and layout of a digital product, such as a website or mobile app. It focuses on functionality, user flow, and content placement rather than colors or detailed visuals. As an essential early step in the design process, wireframing helps designers and stakeholders visualize how users will interact with the interface, identify usability issues, and make quick adjustments before moving to high-fidelity designs or development. This ensures a more efficient, user-centered, and cost-effective design workflow.
